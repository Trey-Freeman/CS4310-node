## Description
It is an easy to use, web based application that will help dispatchers and drivers do the following tasks:

* Get turn by turn directions to their destinations.
* Estimate trip costs by using our cost calculator. This will allow dispatchers to provide quick estimates for any trips to customers.  
* Log events through our interface, where drivers can keep an up to date record of their activities for the day.
* Video conference and chat with other team members at any time and from any place in the world.
* Have team specific meetings/chats through the use of our private chat rooms.
* Contacting the admin in case of technical difficulty.
* Review driver time sheets and payments.
